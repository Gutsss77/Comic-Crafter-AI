### --- Problem Description --- ###

The objective of this project is to develop an application that generates a comic book-style short story based on a user-provided prompt. The story will be divided into four parts: introduction, storyline, climax, and moral of the story. The project will be executed in four phases:

  1 -> Phase 1: LLM Story Generation using Prompting :
    1.1 -> Develop a module that uses LLMs to generate a coherent story based on the userâ€™s prompt.
    1.2 -> The story should be divided into four distinct parts: introduction, storyline, climax, and moral.

  2 -> Phase 2: Image Generation : 
    2.1 -> Create a module that generates images corresponding to each part of the story using AI-based image generation tools.
    2.2 -> Ensure that the images align with the narrative.

  3 -> Phase 3: Merging Story Prompts and Images : 
    3.1 -> Develop a system to merge the generated text and images into a cohesive comic  book format.
    3.2 ->Ensure that the text and images are appropriately aligned and formatted.

  4 -> Phase 4: Integration into an App : 
    4.1 -> Integrate the story generation, image generation, and merging modules into a single web application.
    4.2 -> Ensure the app is user-friendly and can run efficiently on edge devices.
